Display full screen images

To convert the input images into 4 colors images, `ImageMagick` must be installed.

* Put images in `assets/original`

* Use the `build_assets.sh`

example:

`bash build_assets.sh` will convert images to `assets/gb`, generate image as C array to `src`

* build the rom with `make`


All images in the `assets/orignal` directory are packed into the rom.
